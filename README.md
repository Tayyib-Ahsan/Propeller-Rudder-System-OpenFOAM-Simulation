# Propeller-Rudder-System-OpenFOAM-Simulation
This repository showcases a simulation from my research projects.

The boundary type of outerCylinder is changed from 'wall' type to
'symmetry' type using a python script. Users are recommended to 
use the Allrun script with Python3 downloaded.

This simulation is done at advance coefficient (J) 0.534. The
VP1304 propeller and a rudder constracted with NACA 0012 was 
used for this simulation at a rudder angle of 15 degrees to port.

The mesh is by no means optimum. This was just a rough start for 
a series of simulations of improved meshing.

Thank You !!!
